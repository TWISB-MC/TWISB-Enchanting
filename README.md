This is the Github for the minecraft mod "TWISB Enchanting" 

Have you ever rage-quit the game after wasting all your hard-earned levels on "Bane of Arthropods" when trying to get "Sharpness"? Tired of endlessly exploting villagers to get "Mending" just so you can keep your tools? Well, this mod is for you!

TWISB Enchanting improves the vanilla enchanting experience by introducing a method to pick enhantments: Catalysts. These rare items are found by exploring the world and can be used in the enchanting table to ensure you will get the enchantment you need. For example, using the "Smoldering Catalysts" with a sword guarantees "Fire Aspect". Using a catalyst does not destory the item, so once you find one you'll always have it!

Notes: you can select one of the enchantments but others will be random as usual. If the selected enchantment type cannot be obtained with the current number of bookshelves you will get a random one as normal. The tooltip in the enchanting table is still random, so you might not see the enchantment you were expecting, but don't worry: it will still work!

Additionally, repairing tools at anvils using materials (a diamond for a diamond pickaxe) no longer increases the prior work penalty. You'll be able to keep repairing your tools at a reasonable price!

I created this mod to make Minecraft enchanting less tedious while keeping it as close to Vanilla as possible. Incidentally, it also made exploration quite a bit more rewarding. (Mojang, if you read this, I would love if you added these changes to the game).
